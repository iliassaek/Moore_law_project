# Moore law project

## Problem defintion
Each yeach the number of transitors increases exponentially. This project will make us sure that it's the case using a dataset from intel .

## What we'll do 
* cleaning the data
* see the progress of the number of transistors in a chip throug years in a plot
* transform this exponential problem to a linear problem
* finding linear equation that fit the data set
* predicting the number of years needed by the number of transistors to double

## libraries used
* matplotlib
* numpy
* re
* pandas

## How to run it ?
* Make sure that your python interpreter can use the libraries below
* Go to terminale and type
    ```bash
        python lin_reg.py
    ```
